Today, we're changing our name and expanding our product footprint. We are now [__market.dev__](https://www.market.dev).

Our goal is the same - to help more developers become independent business owners - with tools to market, sell services & digital products, and manage their business. For existing users, nothing changes (except for a shiny new domain) - all [__gitwallet.co__](gitwallet.co) links will automatically redirect to [__market.dev__](https://market.dev).

Along with the new name, we've also started building [__a new marketplace__](https://explore.market.dev) of experts & resources in open source communities. 

To do this, our approach is to create one of the most comprehensive directories of experts in developer ecosystems, allow experts to to claim their profile, and to use this as a new channel to sell services & digital products. Check it out at [__explore.market.dev__](https://explore.market.dev). Stay tuned for more information on what you can do with this - very soon.

We think that commerce can move much faster in developer ecosystems - for everything from services to software - and we're excited about building towards this future as [__market.dev__](https://market.dev). For updates, follow us on X as [__@marketdotdev__](https://x.com/marketdotdev) and Bluesky [__@market.dev__](https://bsky.app/profile/market.dev).
