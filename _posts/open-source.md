Today we're announcing that **market.dev is now open source** under an MIT License. We'll maintain a hosted version on market.dev, along with a new simpler pricing plan.

To be frank, the "why" is more of a "why not". Building alongside our customers in the open only makes sense - many of them are already active open source maintainers, using market.dev to sell commercial services packages. We want to give them the opportunity to shape the product as they want, and giving anyone the opportunity to file a PR is the best way to make that happen. We're also going to be announcing some bounties for new features soon!

This also allows us to enable self hosting, so you can use market.dev as the all-in-one CRM and payments platform on your personal sites. If you're interested in some of the things we're working on, check out a snapshot of [our roadmap](https://x.com/marketdotdev/status/1915822315079700643).

More than anything, I'm excited about everything we'll learn about building in the open. If you're interested in contributing, **[check out the code on GitHub](https://github.com/market-dot-dev/)** and Star one of our repos!
