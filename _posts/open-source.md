Today we're announcing that **market.dev is now open source** under an AGPLv3 License. We'll maintain a hosted version on market.dev, along with a new simpler pricing plan.

We're doing this for two reasons: to create a faster path for community contributions, and enable self hosting.

Building alongside our customers in the open only makes sense, and it also gives us to provide customers with a new way to shape our product - by filing a PR directly. We'll also be issuing a few bounties soon.

Our goal with self hosting is to be the back office for your personal website. We want to power *app.yoursite.com* for every freelancer, consultant or anyone offering developer services.

More than anything, I'm excited about everything we'll learn about building in the open. If you're interested in contributing, **[check out the code on GitHub](https://github.com/market-dot-dev/)** and Star one of our repos!
